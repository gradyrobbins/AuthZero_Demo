First, I learned about some important concepts that React introduces (like the component architecture and the JSX syntax).

I also didn't have the chance to learn what gives React a solid foundation when it comes to manipulating HTML elements. Unfortunately, diving deep into these topics is not possible as it would make the article massive (more than it is already).
