## This FULLSTACK Application was built by following a [tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/react-tutorial-building-and-securing-your-first-app/)  by  [Bruno Krebs](https://auth0.com/blog/authors/bruno-krebs/)

:heavy_check_mark: FRONTEND using React to allow users to interact with one another, asking and answering questions

:heavy_check_mark: BACKEND API with Node.js and Express

:heavy_check_mark: AUTH0 technology to authenticate users 


## How to run this app:
### Open a terminal in your operating system, move to a directory where you create your projects, and issue the following commands:

```git clone https://github.com/gradyrobbins/AuthZero_Demo.git ```

```cd AuthZero_Demo```

```cd backend```

### use NPM to start the backend 
```npm install```

```npm start``` should open http://localhost:8081 in your browser.  

```node src```

### navigate to AuthZero_Demo/frontend to run your React app

```cd ../../frontend```

### start your React app
```npm install ```
```npm start```


## Conclusion 
I learned about some important concepts that React introduces (like the component architecture and the JSX syntax). Then, I briefly learned how to create a backend API with Node.js and Express. After that, I learned how to create a nice React application and how to secure the whole thing with Auth0.

The article introduced a lot of different topics, so I didn't really grasp all of them fully. For example, I barely touched the tip of the iceberg on some important concepts like the Component Lifecycle. I also didn't have the chance to learn what gives React a solid foundation when it comes to manipulating HTML elements. Unfortunately, diving deep into these topics is not possible as it would make the article massive (more than it is already).
