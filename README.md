## How to run this app:

### Conclusion 
I learned about some important concepts that React introduces (like the component architecture and the JSX syntax). Then, I briefly learned how to create a backend API with Node.js and Express. After that, I learned how to create a nice React application and how to secure the whole thing with Auth0.

As the article introduced a lot of different topics, I didn't really have the chance to grasp all of them fully. For example, I barely touched the tip of the iceberg on some important concepts like the Component Lifecycle. I also didn't have the chance to learn what gives React a solid foundation when it comes to manipulating HTML elements. Unfortunately, diving deep into these topics is not possible as it would make the article massive (more than it is already).
